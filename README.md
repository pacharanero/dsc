# dsc

A Discourse CLI tool written in Rust. Manage multiple Discourse forums from your terminal — track installs, run upgrades over SSH, manage emojis, perform backups, and sync topics and categories as local Markdown.

Most functionality uses the Discourse REST API. `dsc update` runs remote rebuilds via SSH.

## Features

- Track any number of Discourse installs via a single config file.
- Manage categories, topics, settings, and groups across installs.
- Run rebuilds over SSH and optionally post changelog updates.
- Import from text or CSV, or add installs ad-hoc.
- Pull/push individual topics or whole categories as Markdown.
- Upload custom emojis in bulk.
- List, install, and remove themes and plugins.
- Create, list, and restore backups.

## What works today

A glance at where `dsc` is, so you can tell whether it covers your use case before installing. Almost everything below works over the Discourse REST API; server lifecycle uses SSH.

| Area | Works now | On the roadmap |
|---|---|---|
| **Topics & posts** | pull / push / sync as Markdown, reply, create, rename (`topic title`), set tags, full-thread export; per-post edit / delete / move | — |
| **Categories** | list; pull / push a whole category as Markdown with durable `topic_id` binding, a reviewable dry-run plan, `--updates-only` and `--no-bump`; copy | MkDocs ↔ Discourse admonition & link conversion |
| **Tags** | pull / push the taxonomy, rename, per-topic tag / untag | — |
| **Site settings** | get / set / list, pull / push snapshots, diff two sources, **audit one setting across every forum** | — |
| **Themes & palettes** | list / install / remove / pull / push / duplicate / show; component settings; enable / disable; attach / detach; colour palettes | per-field SCSS editing, asset upload + bind, remote component update |
| **Users & access** | list / info, suspend / silence, promote / demote, group membership, activity export, create, password reset, email change; invites; private messages; API keys; **one-shot SAR / GDPR export** | scoped API keys, find-user-by-email |
| **Backups, emoji, uploads** | backup create / list / pull / push / restore, bulk emoji, file upload | backup-all |
| **Fleet (multi-install)** | one config for N forums, tag filtering, write a setting across matching installs, audit a setting across all, update-all over SSH | cross-forum search & aggregate reports |
| **Server lifecycle** | `harden` a fresh box, stages 1-2 (new sudo user, pubkey auth, sshd lockdown to a non-standard port); `update` over SSH with skip-if-current | `harden` stage 3 - firewall, Docker, swap, fail2ban (config keys wired, SSH execution pending); one-shot `dsc install` provisioning |
| **Reporting** | analytics snapshot (growth / activity / health); `log staff` audit-trail inspection | dashboard reports, webhooks, notifications |

Exploratory (not committed): `dsc chat`, a TUI, and an MCP server mode. See [spec/roadmap.md](spec/roadmap.md) for the full picture.

## Installation

### Shell installer — Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -LsSf https://pacharanero.github.io/dsc/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads a prebuilt binary for your platform and installs it to `~/.cargo/bin` (or `$CARGO_HOME/bin` if set). Supports `x86_64` and `aarch64` on both Linux and macOS.

This short URL proxies to cargo-dist's real installer on the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/pacharanero/dsc/releases/latest) — fine for most purposes, but if you'd rather pin to a specific version or audit the script you can fetch it directly from the release assets.

### PowerShell installer — Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://pacharanero.github.io/dsc/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Downloads the Windows `x86_64` binary and installs it to `%CARGO_HOME%\bin`.

### Homebrew — Linux and macOS

```bash
brew tap pacharanero/tap
brew install dsc-rs
```

The formula name matches the crate name (`dsc-rs`); the installed binary is still `dsc`.

### Windows installer (MSI)

Download `dsc-rs-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi` from the [latest release](https://github.com/pacharanero/dsc/releases/latest) and double-click. The installer is unsigned, so Windows will show a SmartScreen warning the first time — click "More info" → "Run anyway".

### From crates.io

If you already have a Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo install dsc-rs
```

The crate is published as `dsc-rs` (the `dsc` name was taken), but the installed binary is still `dsc`.

### Direct download

Prebuilt archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows are attached to every [GitHub release](https://github.com/pacharanero/dsc/releases/latest). Download, extract, and drop `dsc` (or `dsc.exe`) anywhere on your `PATH`.

### From source

Requires Rust 1.95.0 or newer (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacharanero/dsc.git
cd dsc
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a config file
cat > dsc.toml <<'EOF'
[[discourse]]
name = "myforum"
baseurl = "https://forum.example.com"
apikey = "<api key>"
api_username = "system"
ssh_host = "forum.example.com"
changelog_topic_id = 123
EOF

# dsc.toml holds a live API key in plain text - keep it readable only by you
chmod 600 dsc.toml

# Verify API (and SSH, if configured) connectivity before doing anything else
dsc config check

# List configured forums (read-only)
dsc list

# Pull a topic into Markdown for editing (read-only)
dsc topic pull myforum 42

# Preview a push before it touches the live forum
dsc --dry-run topic push myforum 42 ./topic-title.md

# Push the edited topic back up for real
dsc topic push myforum 42 ./topic-title.md

# Update a forum over SSH - a real remote rebuild, no dry-run preview for this one
dsc update myforum
```
