# dsc backup

Create, list, download, restore, and set up off-site (S3) backups.

## dsc backup create

```
dsc backup create <discourse>
```

Triggers a backup on the specified Discourse. The backup is created server-side; it is not downloaded locally.

## dsc backup list

```
dsc backup list <discourse> [--format text|markdown|markdown-table|json|yaml|csv]
```

Lists all backups on the specified Discourse. Supports the same formats as `dsc list`.

## dsc backup pull

```text
dsc backup pull <discourse> <backup-filename> [<local-path>]
```

Downloads a backup archive to the local filesystem. `<backup-filename>` is the name shown by `dsc backup list`. If `<local-path>` is omitted, the file is saved in the current directory with the same name.

```bash
dsc backup pull myforum discourse-2026-04-17-230000.tar.gz
dsc backup pull myforum discourse-2026-04-17-230000.tar.gz ./backups/
```

## dsc backup push

```text
dsc backup push <discourse> <backup-path>
```

Restores the specified backup (alias: `dsc backup restore`). `<backup-path>` is the backup filename as shown by `dsc backup list`.

Restoration is destructive and irreversible. Use `--dry-run` (or `-n`) to preview the operation before committing:

```bash
dsc --dry-run backup push myforum discourse-2026-04-17-230000.tar.gz
```

## dsc backup setup-s3

```text
dsc backup setup-s3 <discourse> [--region <r>] [--bucket <name>] [--no-test]
```

Provisions off-site backups on Amazon S3 in one command, replacing the per-forum AWS-console runbook: it creates a private bucket, a dedicated **single-bucket** IAM user + least-privilege policy, mints an access key, and points Discourse's S3 backup settings at it - then (unless `--no-test`) triggers a backup and confirms it lands in the bucket.

Defaults derive from the forum's config name:

- bucket `<name>-discourse-backups`, policy `s3-single-bucket-<name>-discourse-backups`, user `<name>-discourse-backup-user`
- region `eu-west-2` (override with `--region`); bucket override with `--bucket`

**Requirements & safety:**

- The [`aws` CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) must be installed and configured with a profile that has IAM + S3 admin rights. Those provisioning credentials are used only by `aws` and are **never stored by `dsc`**. The minted least-privilege key is written straight into the Discourse setting (not into `dsc.toml`) and is **never printed**.
- This creates real AWS resources and writes production settings. **Always preview with `-n` / `--dry-run` first** - it prints the resolved names, the full IAM policy JSON, the exact `aws` commands, and the settings diff, and touches nothing.

```bash
# 1) Review the complete plan (creates nothing)
dsc backup setup-s3 -n myforum

# 2) Provision for real (eu-west-2 by default)
dsc backup setup-s3 myforum --region eu-west-1
```

> Phase 1 covers the create-everything flow. `--reuse-user` (idempotent re-runs / key rotation), `--use-iam-profile` (EC2 instance role, no static keys), and `--all`/`--tags` (fleet-wide) are planned - see [spec/commands/backup-s3-setup.md](../spec/commands/backup-s3-setup.md).
